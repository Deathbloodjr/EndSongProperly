 This is a TDMX mod to end songs when the chart ends, rather than when the song ends.\
 \
 This only really has an affect on a few songs that use custom preview songs, where they would end up taking 30+ seconds to end while waiting for the preview songs to play out. \
 \
 You can create a basic text file with a list of SongIds to end. Put that file path in the config file, or name it "EndSongProperlySongIds.txt" and place it in the TakoTako CustomSongs folder if you have that installed (which you should, otherwise you wouldn't have any songs that would require this mod).
